Version 0.43	11/01/2023

	Documentation updates

Version 0.42	10/24/2023

	Magellan Motion Control IC User Guide.pdf	v3.0
	C-Motion.dll was not exporting functions as __stdcall.
	PRP over CANFD required an added length field because the DLC bit field is not linear.
	Simplified handling of the PRP 3 padding bytes. (PMDRP.cpp, PMDRPperiph.cpp)
	Fixed - The NVRAM erase command were timing out prematurely which cause subsequent communications to fail.
	Fixed - PMDIXXATCAN4.c was not handling multiple packets sent/received in a sequence.
	Switched to v4 of the IXXAT driver.

Version 0.41	4/04/2023

	32-bit align SPIpacket[] buffer.
	Some changes to the host SPI driver (PMDPspi.c) to simplify embedded migration.
	
Version 0.40	3/08/2023

	Fixed some missing or incorrect PRP II functions.
	Modified : /CMESDK/C-Motion/Include/PMDdevice.h
	Modified : /CMESDK/CMECode/UserImport.S

	Added PMD_Default_TCPKeepAliveInterval
	Modified : /CMESDK/C-Motion/Include/PMDRPtypes.h

	Return PMD_ERR_MutexTimeout if mutex lock fails.
	Yield to any waiting tasks after unlocking the mutex to prevent starving other tasks.
	Modified : /CMESDK/C-Motion/C/PMDRPperiph.cpp

	Fixed - AddFilter was returning "The component is not initialized."
	Modified : /CMESDK/C-Motion/C/PMDIXXATCAN4.c

	Fixed - compiling with OPT = 3 was reordering the user task functions
	Modified : /CMESDK/CMECode/Makefile

	Renamed SSI Resolution to BiSS Resolution
	Modified : /CMESDK/C-Motion/Include/PMDRPtypes.h
	
	Improvements to StoreUserCode.exe.
	Added some command line switches.
	Added LogPRPConsole().
	Modified : /CMESDK/HostCode/Examples/StoreUserCode/StoreUserCode.c
	Modified : /CMESDK/HostCode/Release/StoreUserCode.exe

Version 0.30	10/05/2022

	C-Motion version 10.0
	Renamed "event" variable which is a keyword in VB.
	Host SPI implementation (16-bit aligned)
	Fixed - memory leak caused by creating more than one mutex. 
	Fixed potential buffer overflow in GetUserCode??? functions
	Fixed exception when closing an invalid memory or device handle.
	Added PMDDeviceInfo_Heap
	Fixed remote/attached device access.
	New API naming convention
	Moved all "PMD_" enums for generating PRP packets only into newly created PMDrpcode.h. 
	Added NVRAM1 and NVRAM2 individual 128K sectors of 256K NVRAM to access individual sectors.
	PMDser.c: Fixed - mutex was not being unlocked on certain error conditions.
	PMDser.c: Removed PMDPeriphFlush before sending a Magellan command. 
	Fixed - Specific user code was generating a new section (.ARM.exidx) that caused the CopyDataSectionToRAM to be off by 4 bytes.
	Fixed - Compiler optimization level (OPT=0) can now be set from 0 to 3. Default is 0 to ease debugging.
	Return PMD_ERR_Timeout if Magellan does not respond instead of PMD_ERR_InsufficientDataReceived.

Version 0.22	05/26/2022

	Changes:
	Fixed compiler errors and warnings
	Renamed PAR to PIO
	Removed PMDPCOM_SetTimeout from PMDPCOM_Send because handshaking is not enabled.
	PMDIXXATCAN4.c:  Was not able to receive more than 8-byte buffers.
	Fixed - potential memory leak if PMDRPDeviceOpen failed.
	Added higher serial baud rates that nION can support
	Added PMDDeviceGetInfo
	Changed PMDFaultCode_Exception_? values to fit in the subcommand byte
